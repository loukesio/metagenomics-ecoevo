## Metagenomics course for the Applied Bioinformatics Masters 

### Details 
- **Location**: Online
- **Date**: April 1st 2024
- **Speakers**: Loukas Theodosiou

### Abstract
  In this metagenomics lecture, participants will be introduced to the principles and latest updates in the field of metagenomics, including amplicon sequencing, 16S sequencing, and whole-genome shotgun sequencing approaches. Participants will not only grasp the technical details for analyzing these types of data but also gain insights into the eco-evolutionary processes that these data can elucidate. As an exercise, students will break into teams at the end of the lecture to conceptualize a company they could start using metagenomics principles. During the practicum, students will become familiar with state-of-the-art tools for analyzing metagenomic data, including an introduction to machine learning techniques. Basic knowledge of R, Python, and Bash, as well as the conda package manager, is required. All students should bring their own PC with at least 5 GB of free space and be able to install conda modules.
